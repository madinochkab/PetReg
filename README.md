# pet reg
Create an application which registers a pet into the system. The application should ask how many pets they would like to register. For each pet, they should be asked what type of pet they will be registering (dog, cat, fish, bird, reptile, or horse). If the type is not a valid registrable pet, the system should let the user know but if it is an acceptable pet than the price should be confirmed with the user. When confirming the price to register the pet for 1 year, you should use a switch statement to determine the price. If the user decides to follow through with the registration process, they should than enter the pets name (String), address(String), age (int), whether they have a Rabies shot (boolean), yearly pet fees (double), and gender (char) - you should use your helper methods to save time coding this. The number of pets that will be entered into the array, should be determined at the start of the application and modified if they decide to register that pet. Upon exiting, all the registered pet details should be echoed to the user. Good Luck!

*In case you don't know where to start:

Create the functions/ methods that make up the required steps
Implement the methods in small steps making sure your code compiles correctly through out the creation process
Use the Request Helper Methods to move you faster along
